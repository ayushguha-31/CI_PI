Derived Insights:
The scatter plot shows the relationship between the independent variable (X_test) and the dependent variable (y), with the blue dots representing the actual data points and the red line representing the predicted values by the linear regression model.
The shaded region around the red line represents the prediction interval, which provides a range where we expect future observations to fall with a certain level of confidence.
The shaded region around the red line represents the confidence interval, which provides a range where we expect the true regression line to fall with a certain level of confidence.
The equation of the model (y = Intercept + Coefficient * X) allows us to understand how changes in the independent variable (X) affect the dependent variable (y).
These insights can be valuable for making predictions and understanding the relationship between variables, which can inform business decisions such as pricing strategies, demand forecasting, and resource allocation.
